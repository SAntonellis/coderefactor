# coderefactor

This repo contains the HTML/CSS files and image assets for the Horiseon website. I have updated both of the HTML and CSS code documentation with comments that illustrate what briefly what each section of code is responsible for. I have also rearranged some of the coding structure for easier readability, consolidating classes in CSS that have duplicate values and using semantic HTML elements.
